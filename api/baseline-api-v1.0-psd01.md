# 1 Introduction

The Baseline Protocol is an open-source initiative that combines advances in cryptography, messaging, and consensus-controlled state machines often referred to as blockchains or distributed ledger technology (DLT) to deliver secure and private business processes at low cost -- event ordering, data consistency, and workflow integrity. The Baseline Protocol provides a framework that allows Baseline Protocol Implementations (BPIs) to establish a common (business) frame of reference enabling confidential and complex (business) collaborations between enterprises without moving any sensitive data between traditional Systems of Record. The work is a [Ethereum Community Project](https://github.com/ethereum/oasis-open-project), which is managed by [OASIS](https://oasis-open-projects.org/).

## 1.0 IPR Policy

The Baseline Protocol API Specification is provided under the [RF on Limited Terms](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/ipr/#RF-on-Limited-Mode) Mode of the OASIS IPR Policy, the mode chosen when the Technical Committee was established.

For information on whether any patents have been disclosed that may be essential to implementing this specification, and any offers of patent licensing terms, please refer to the Intellectual Property Rights section of the TC’s web page (https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/legalruleml/ipr.php).

## 1.1 Terminology

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119).

## 1.2 Normative References

**[RFC4122]** Leach, P., Mealling, M., and R. Salz, "A Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN Namespace", RFC 4122, DOI 10.17487/RFC4122, July 2005, <https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc4122>.
